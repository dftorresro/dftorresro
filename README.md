### Hello, I’m Daniel Torres! 👋

🎓 **Currently**: I’m completing my Diplôme d'ingénieur in France, specializing in Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Data Science. Throughout my studies, I’ve built expertise in machine learning, image processing, and large language models (LLMs), with a particular interest in how these technologies can be applied to **astronomy** and **astrophysics**. 🌌

### 🔍 **Areas of Focus**:

- 🧠 **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Designing systems that can learn, make decisions, and adapt.
- 👁️ **Computer Vision**: Developing algorithms for image analysis, object detection, and scene understanding.
- 🛰️ **Remote Sensing**: Using satellite data to monitor environmental changes, natural disasters, and land use.
- 📊 **Data Science**: Applying advanced analytics and machine learning to draw insights from complex datasets.

### 🚀 **What I’m Looking For**:

I’m seeking an **end-of-studies internship** in **computer vision**, **remote sensing**, **AI**, or **natural language processing (NLP)**. I’m eager to apply my skills and take on roles where I can contribute to developing systems that interpret and analyze visual or textual data.

### 🤝 **Let’s Connect**:

For inquiries regarding collaboration, internships, or opportunities in AI, computer vision, or data science, please reach out to me through.
