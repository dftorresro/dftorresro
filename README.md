👋 Hello, I’m Daniel Torres

💻 Now: I’ve recently completed my Diplôme d’ingénieur at Télécom Paris – Institut Polytechnique de Paris, specializing in Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Software Engineering. I’m currently wrapping up a research internship at InterDigital, where I develop compression tools for 3D point cloud data, contributing to MPEG standardization.

🔍 What I Build & Care About:
	•	⚙️ AI Systems Engineering – Bridging theory and production: clean, testable, scalable code.
	•	🧠 Machine Learning & Computer Vision – Solving real-world problems with robust models.
	•	🧱 3D Geometry & Signal Processing – Working with point clouds, transforms, and codecs.
	•	📈 Metrics & Observability – Designing pipelines that are measurable, debuggable, and efficient.
	•	🌐 Software Infrastructure – Git, CI/CD, SLURM, Docker, and the tooling that powers research at scale.

🚀 What I’m Looking For:

I’m currently seeking opportunities in:
	•	Software Engineering
	•	AI Infrastructure
	•	Computer Vision
	•	3D Data & Geometry
	•	Metrics/Monitoring & Performance

Whether it’s research-driven development or system-level implementation, I’m excited to work on teams that value clean code, learning, and impact.
